# Autonomous Driving


The self driving vehicles that does not involve human intervention is known as Autonomous Driving. An exponential increase of the vehicles on the streets have raised concerns associated
with traffic congestion, the safety of road users and fatal road accidents. These key issues
have resulted in an increased demand for Autonomous Driving (AD). Despite stringent
government regulations, complete safety of road users is still not guaranteed. These issues
can be addressed by introducing the technology-driven solution called as Advanced Driver
Assistance System (ADAS)

The term ADAS defines vehicle-based intelligent systems which assists the driver
in the driving process. ADAS reduces driving effort with precision driving, efficient
performance and enhanced safety. The main objective of ADAS is to ensure safety for
all road users. ADAS can guide drivers in terms of crash avoidance, intelligent speed
adaptation, advanced braking systems, lane assistance and have the potential to prevent
major risks involved in transportation

A complete visual perception of the surrounding environment is needed for ADAS to
ensure good performance. A human being or an animal understands the environment
around by evaluating signals from different senses, like vision, sound, touch, and feel.
Likewise, we use several sensors around the ego vehicle to perceive the 3D environment.
The common sensors used in the automotive field are cameras, radars, ultrasonic sensors,
LiDAR, position estimators and Electronic Control Unit (ECU). Sometimes, the sensor
data is recorded individually and processed to understand the behavior of the objects
around. Mostly, the data from several sensors are fused together, calibrated against each
other and then the fused data is analyzed and evaluated. The fused data has increased
confidence, improved resolution, reduced ambiguity and robustness against interference
It is a set of data points in space whcih represents 3D shape of an object. Each point in the point cloud has its own X, Y and Z coordinates.
